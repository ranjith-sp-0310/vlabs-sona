# E-commerce SQL Injection Virtual Lab

Welcome to the E-commerce SQL Injection Virtual Lab! This lab is designed to help you understand and practice identifying and mitigating SQL Injection vulnerabilities in an E-commerce website.

## Overview

SQL Injection is a common security vulnerability that occurs when an application fails to properly validate or sanitize user inputs before executing SQL queries. In this virtual lab, you'll play the role of a security researcher tasked with identifying and fixing SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the E-commerce website.

## Lab Modules

The lab is divided into several modules, each focusing on different aspects of SQL Injection vulnerabilities and mitigation. Here are the main modules you'll encounter:

1. **Introduction:** Get acquainted with the lab environment and SQL Injection basics.
2. **Login Page Vulnerability:** Explore a vulnerable login page and understand the SQL Injection concept.
3. **Exploiting User Data:** Attempt to exploit the vulnerability to retrieve user data.
4. **Protection Mechanisms:** Learn about various mechanisms to protect against SQL Injection.
5. **Secure Coding:** Implement security best practices to prevent SQL Injection.
6. **Mitigation Testing:** Verify your fixes and understand the importance of security testing.
